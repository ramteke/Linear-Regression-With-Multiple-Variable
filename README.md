Given predict the price of a house with 1650 square feet and 3 bedrooms ?


<b>How to Solve this ?</b><br>

<img src="Linear%20Regression%20-%20Multiple.png">

<b>Step 1:</b> Normalize the data, i.e  normalized_value = current_value * mean / standard-deviation

<b>Step 2:</b>  Based on formula, calculate theta:
  
  theta = theta - (alpha / m) * (X'*X*theta - X' * y);
  
<b>Step 3:</b> Predict for some value house with 1650 square feet and 3 bedrooms ?
  
  normalize_size =  1650 - mean(sq.ft) / std(sq.ft)
  normalize_rooms = 3 - mean(rooms) / std(rooms)
  
  Y = [ 1 , normalize_size,  normalize_rooms] * theta
